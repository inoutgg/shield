## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Will shield support other databases (mysql, sqlite, database/sql, etc.)?</summary>

No, not at the moment. There is no intention to adapt this framework for other stacks in the near future. As focusing on a specific technology stack it helps to iterate faster and delivery more stable features.

Later, however, support for additional stacks can be added.
